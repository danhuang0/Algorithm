## Introduction of LinkedList
LinkedList is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored in contigous memory addresses. Instead, the elements in a LinkedList are linked using pointers.

## Concepts of LinkedList
1. Node </br>
   Each element of a LinkedList is called a 'Node'.
2. Head </br>
   The first node of a LinkedList is called 'Head'.
3. Next </br>
   The pointer/reference of each node that points to the next node.
4. Tail </br>
   The last node of a LinkedList. It's next pointer points at null.

## Advantanges and Disadvantages of LinkedList
LinkedList is one of the simplest and most common data struture. It has advantanges and disadvantages.
- Advantages
  * Quick for insertion and deletion.
  * Size of LinkedList increases or decreases dynamically.
- Disadvantages
  * Does not allow random access. It takes linear time to visit an element.
  * Use more memory than Array because of the storage used by pointers.
  * Difficult for reverse traversing.
