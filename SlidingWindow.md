# Sliding Window

## How to identify sliding window problems
- The problems will involve a data structure that is ordered and iterable like an array, a string or a linked list.
- The problems often ask for contigous and optimal things, like the longest sequence or shortest sequence of something that satisfies a given condition exactly.

## Sliding window problems are dynamic programming problems
Sliding window problems are a subset of dynamic programming problems because
- Overrlapping: The subproblems are overlapping.
- Optimal Substructure: The overall optimal solution can be obtained by using optimal solutions of its subproblems.
