## Introduction
Array rotation means shifting array elements to the left or right by specified positions.

## Left Rotation
Left rotation of an array means shifting the array elements towards the left by k positions. For a given number ```nums[i]```, it will becomes ```nums[(i + n - k) % n]```


## Right Rotation
Right rotation of an array means shifting the array elements towards the right by k positions. For a given number ```nums[i]```, it will becomes ```nums[(i + k) % n]```
