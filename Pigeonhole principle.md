# Pigeonhole principle
The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

# Proof of correctness
Suppose none of the m container has more than one item, then the total number of items would be at most m. This contradicts the statement that we have more than m items.
