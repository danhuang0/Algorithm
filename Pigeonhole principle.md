# Pigeonhole principle
The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

# Proof of correctness
Suppose none of the m container has more than one item, then the total number of items would be at most m. This contradicts the statement that we have more than m items.

# Examples
- Amony any 13 people, at least two share a birth month. </br>
  Treat each month as a box and label them with the name of the month. Then put each person in the box that labeled with his/her birth month. According to the pigenhole principle, at least two people will be put into the same box.
  
 - There are 5 pairs of socks are in a drawer. Picking 6 socks will guarantee that at least one pair is chosen. </br>
  Suppose there are five boxes labeled with "Pair #1", "Pair #2", etc. Put the 6 socks into the boxes labelled with corresponding number. According to the pigenhow principle, at least two socks have the same number.
